<p>Db4oTool.exe can also be used to pre optimize the Native Queries in a given 
assembly. This makes it possible to deploy an application without Db4objects.Db4o.NativeQueries.dll 
(the assembly where the Native Query runtime optimizer lives) and Db4objects.Db4o.Instrumentation.dll, while also 
possibly reducing Native Query execution time by dropping runtime analysis 
completely.</p>
<p>
Execute the Db4oTool.exe command line utility without any 
arguments and check out the help information.</p></span>
