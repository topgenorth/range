<p>Db4o rules for delegate fields are very straightforward:&nbsp;<b>delegates are simply not stored.</b><br><br>Events and delegates are generally used for binding user interface elements&nbsp;and domain models together. The Db4o team felt that not storing&nbsp;delegate fields by default was more appropriate than opening&nbsp;what could potentially be a very nasty can of worms&nbsp;(just think of a text box bound to a Customer.Changed event).<br><br>After careful thought we can easily add delegate persistence to our&nbsp;domain model by either installing translators for the delegate types&nbsp;of interest or reconnecting the necessary objects upon activation&nbsp;using callbacks.<br><br>For details see the specific chapters on&nbsp;<a href="../translators.html" class="wikiLink">Translators</a> and&nbsp;<a href="../callbacks.html" class="wikiLink">Callbacks</a>.<br><br></span><br></p></div>
