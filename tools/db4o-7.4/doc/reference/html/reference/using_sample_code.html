material with example code, which can be used for the material evaluation and
better understanding.</p>

<p>The examples are provided in java, c# and VB.NET. In the
online version, you can use filters on the right pane to display the relevant
content. Offline version provides the content depending on the downloaded
version of db4o.</p>

<p>Most of the examples are console applications except for
those clearly mentioning the environment (web-applications, windows forms etc.).</p>

<p>.Net examples are .NET2.0 compatible.</p>

<a name="Variables"></a><h2>Variables</h2>

<p>The in-text code snippets are mainly used to show the syntax
of a particular method. The following variables are used:</p>

<p><code>objectContainer</code> - references and open
ObjectContainer/IObjectContainer or ObjectClient/IobjectClient. For more
information see <a href="object_lifecycle/object_container.html" class="wikiLink">Object Container</a> and
<a href="client-server/embedded.html" class="wikiLink">Embedded</a>.</p><code>configuration</code> variable is used to reflect
Configuration object. See <a href="tuning/configuration.html" class="wikiLink">Configuration</a>.



<a name="Embedded Code"></a><h2>Embedded Code</h2>

<p>The examples usually show only the method code demonstrating
the functionality discussed. In this case, additional code (opening and closing
database methods, listing results, global variable definitions) and persistent
class definitions are not visible. In order to see them you can download the
whole example as a *.zip file using the button in the top-right corner of the
example code block. Note: usually the *.zip file contains all the examples for
the current topic.</p>



<p>In the majority of the examples, objectContainer is opened
and closed in each method. This is done to keep examples atomic. In the
real-world application, the best technique would be to open an objectContainer
on the first request and keep it open for the application lifetime.</p>The downloaded code can be easily used to run the examples.

<p>In Visual Studio 2005:</p>

<ul><li>unzip the contents in the /Example folder;</li><li>select "New Project" from the "File" menu;</li><li>select "Console Application" template;</li><li>in the "Solution Explorer" right-click "ConsoleApplication1"
and select "Add/Existing Item";</li><li>navigate to the /Example folder and select all the *.cs files;</li><li>now you can delete the automatically generated Program.cs;</li><li>select "References" in the "Solution Explorer" and add the
required db4o libraries (Db4objects.Db4o.dll, Db4objects.Db4o.Instrumentation.dll. Db4objects.Db4o.NativeQueries.dll);</li><li>if the example archive contains several examples you will need
to go to the project properties and select one of the examples as a "Startup
object";</li><li>build and run the example.</li></ul>
