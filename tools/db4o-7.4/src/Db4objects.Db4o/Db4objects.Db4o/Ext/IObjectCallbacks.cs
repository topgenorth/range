	/// callback methods.
	/// <br /><br />
	/// This interface only serves as a list of all available callback methods.
	/// Every method is called individually, independantly of implementing this interface.<br /><br />
	/// <b>Using callbacks</b><br />
	/// Simply implement one or more of the listed methods in your application classes to
	/// do tasks before activation, deactivation, delete, new or update, to cancel the
	/// action about to be performed and to respond to the performed task.
	/// <br /><br />Callback methods are typically used for:
	/// <br />- cascaded delete
	/// <br />- cascaded update
	/// <br />- cascaded activation
	/// <br />- restoring transient members on instantiation
	/// <br /><br />Callback methods follow regular calling conventions. Methods in superclasses
	/// need to be called explicitely.
	/// <br /><br />All method calls are implemented to occur only once, upon one event.
	/// </remarks>
